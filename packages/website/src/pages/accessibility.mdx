# Accessibility

Because of the low-level nature of react-atmosphere, many accessibility features
need to be implemented in user space. react-atmosphere tries to handle as many a11y
features as it can.

## PopperLayer

Often, a PopperLayer's reference element has a semantic relationship with the
layer (e.g. a dropdown layer for a button). For example, if you are implementing
a menu, you should set the following attributes: `aria-controls`,
`aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup`.

```typescript
function MyComponent() {
  const buttonRef = useRef(null);
  const id = useId();
  const [showPopper, setShowPopper] = React.useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button
        aria-controls={showPopper ? id : undefined}
        aria-expanded={showPopper}
        aria-haspopup={showPopper}
        onClick={() => setShowPopper(true)}
        ref={buttonRef}>
        Show
      </button>
      {showPopper ? <PopperLayer id={id} reference={buttonRef} ... /> : null}
    </>
  );
}
```

## Tooltip

Tooltips handle mouse and focus events. Be sure to transfer all the props from
`Tooltip`'s children render function, which includes aria attributes and event
listeners.

## Dialog

Dialogs are wrapped by `FocusLock`, which keeps focus inside the Dialog while
visible.

Your dialog root component (returned by `Dialog.render`) should have
`aria-model="true"` and `role="dialog"`. You can see this in the [Dialog sandbox](/examples/dialog-setup).

```typescript{3}
function MyDialogRoot({ children }) {
  return (
    <div aria-model role="dialog">
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```
