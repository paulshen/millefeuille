# Performance

`LayerContainer` is a `React.memo` component. Having a parent component that
rerenders frequently will not cause layers to rerender.

`LayerContainer` memoizes layers based on their render functions. Updating a
layer should only cause that layer to rerender, even though `LayerContainer` is
rerendering.

You can skip Layer updates by making your render function referentially equal.

Move state inside your Layer component. This isn't needed as best practice but
is something you can reach for if you are squeezing performance.

###### Having state outside Layer

```typescript
function MyLayer({count, setCount}) {
  ...
}

function MyPage() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  return <Layer render={() => <MyLayer count={count} setCount={setCount} />} />
}
```

###### Moving state inside Layer

```typescript
function MyLayer() {
  // Setting state here avoids rerendering <MyPage> and <Layer>
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  ...
}

function MyPage() {
  return <Layer render={() => <MyLayer />} />
}
```
