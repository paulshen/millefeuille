# react-atmosphere

<p className="intro">
  React building blocks for UI layers (tooltips, dialogs, etc).
</p>
<IndexLayerExample />

## Features

- Declarative component API for rendering/hiding layers.
- Bring your own styles.
- Single container stacks layers based on render order, removing need for most
  z-index.
- Animate layers as they unmount, even if the owner component has unmounted.
  - Try clicking the button above and then a link in the sidebar. Notice the
    exit transition.
- An alternative imperative API.

Unlike similar libraries, react-atmosphere does not use [React Portal](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html).
Instead, a single `<LayerContainer>` subscribes to layer messages emitted by
other `<Layer>` components. This decouples the layer's rendering from its host
component, enabling an imperative API as well as rendering UI after the
component unmounts (useful for unmount animations).

## Getting Started

1. Install `react-atmosphere` from NPM.

```bash
npm install react-atmosphere
# or
yarn add react-atmosphere
```

2. Render a `<LayerContainer>` in your React app. All layers in your app will be
   rendered inside this component. This container is usually rendered at the end
   of your root UI component.

```typescript{7}
import { LayerContainer } from "react-atmosphere"

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      ...
      <LayerContainer />
    </>
  )
}
```

3. Render `<Layer>` components.

```typescript{8}
import { Layer } from "react-atmosphere"

function MyComponent() {
  const [showLayer, setShowLayer] = React.useState(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShowLayer(show => !show)}>Toggle Layer</button>
      {showLayer ? <Layer render={() => <MyLayer />} /> : null}
    </>
  )
}
```

Even though `<Layer>` is a child of `<MyComponent>`, `<MyLayer>` will be
rendered inside the app's `<LayerContainer>`.

## Dive In

### Components

react-atmosphere comes with a number of common Layer components.

| Component                       | Description                                               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`<Layer>`](/layer)             | The heart and building block of the library               |
| [`<PopperLayer>`](/popperlayer) | Layer component that integrates Popper.js for positioning |
| [`<Tooltip>`](/tooltip)         | PopperLayer that responds to mouse events                 |
| [`<Dialog>`](/dialog)           | Modal component rendered over the screen with a backdrop  |

### Exit transitions

If you want a layer to animate as it is unmounting, read about
[exit transitions](/layer#transitionexit).

### Imperative API

You can show and hide layers with an [imperative API](/imperative-api). This is
useful when you don't want to tie a layer's lifecycle to a component.
