# LayerContainer

<p className="intro">The container where all your layers are rendered.</p>

Your app must have exactly one rendered `<LayerContainer>` element. This is
where all layers will be rendered.

This is usually at the root of your app after the other UI elements. This is so
that layers are rendered at the end of the DOM and reduces the need for z-index.

```typescript
import { LayerContainer } from "millefeuille"

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <>
      ...
      <LayerContainer />
    </>
  )
}
```
