# react-layer

A React library for UI layers (tooltips, Dialogs, dropdowns, etc).

## Features

- Declarative component API for rendering/hiding layers.
- Single Layer container stacks layers based on render order, removing need for
  most z-index.
- Animate layers as they unmount, even if the owner (parent) component has
  unmounted.
- An imperative API for managing layers for when it's inconvenient to map to use
  component API.
- millefeuille is designed to be the building blocks for your own UI library.
  The components come with as little styling as possible.

## Getting Started

1. Install `millefeuille` from NPM.

```bash
yarn add millefeuille
```

2. Render a `<LayerContainer>` in your React app. All layers in your app will be
   rendered inside this component. This container is usually rendered at the end
   of your root component.

```typescript
import { LayerContainer } from "millefeuille"

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      ...
      <LayerContainer />
    </>
  )
}
```

3. Render `<Layer>` components.

```typescript
import { Layer } from "millefeuille"

function MyComponent() {
  const [showLayer, setShowLayer] = React.useState(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShowLayer(show => !show)}>Toggle Layer</button>
      {showLayer ? <Layer render={() => <MyLayer />} /> : null}
    </>
  )
}
```

`<MyLayer>` will be rendered inside the `<LayerContainer>`.

### Components

millefeuille comes with a number of common Layer components that you can build
on top of.

| Component             | Description                                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Dialog`              | Component rendered over the screen with a backdrop        |
| `PopperLayer`         | Layer component that integrates popper.js for positioning |
| [`Tooltip`](/tooltip) | PopperLayer that responds to mouse events                 |

### Imperative API

You can show and hide layers with an imperative API. This is useful when you
don't want to tie a layer's lifecycle to a component.
