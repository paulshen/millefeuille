# Performance

`LayerContainer` is a `React.memo` component. Having a parent component that
rerenders frequently will not cause layers to rerender.

`LayerContainer` keeps a cache map of `Layer` object => `ReactElement`. React
will skip rendering of elements that are referentially equal. Updating a layer
should only cause that layer to rerender, even though `LayerContainer` is
rerendering.

Layers will only update if the `render` function has changed. You can skip
renders by making your render function referentially equal.

Move state inside your Layer component. This isn't needed as best practice but
is something you can reach for if you are squeezing performance.

###### Having state outside Layer

```typescript
function MyLayer({count, setCount}) {
  ...
}

function MyPage() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  return <Layer render={() => <MyLayer count={count} setCount={setCount} />} />;
}
```

###### Moving state inside Layer

```typescript
function MyLayer() {
  // Setting state here avoids rerendering <MyPage> and <Layer>
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  ...
}

function MyPage() {
  return <Layer render={() => <MyLayer />} />;
}
```
