# Layer

<LayerExample />

The heart of millefeuille is the `<Layer>` component.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
import { Layer } from "millefeuille"

<Layer render={renderProps => <div>I'm a layer!</div>} />
```

When a `<Layer>` is rendered, its `render` prop is called and rendered inside the `<LayerContainer>`.

React has [Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html), which supports similar functionality. millefeuille does not use React's portal, which decouples the layer's rendering from the host component. This allows support for an imperative API as well as rendering UI after the component unmounts (useful for unmount animations).
